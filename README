OpenRSCD
========

OpenRSCD is a game server which is designed to be protocol-agnostic(generally, disregarding UDP protocols), with a few example modules for specific game client protocols.

Currently, these example modules are going to be for a game called RuneScape Classic(protocol/client version 202), and RuneScape(protocol/client version 317).

If you wish, you may express your wishes for other game protocol support by emailing me at zach@libslack.so.
